# Educational-Projects
The place is containing all the projects I've worked on, which lead me trough journey of data analysis.
I started with Excel and Power Bi, since they operate on a similar engines - those are gonna be the main catalogue's names, along with SQL files.
Every Saturday evening there is an update of my weekly work and for that purpose I will create an Excel spreadsheet, where my progress will be seen.
Since I organize my work in a way that enables quick search after long period of time, a hierarchy is applied into the structores.
